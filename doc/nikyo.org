* RUnit

RUnit can be installed using the command

=install.package("RUnit")=

Then to use it you simply reference the library

=library("RUnit")=

** Resources

There is a webpage discussing the RUnit and testthat library at
[[http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/17/unit-testing-in-r-the-bare-minimum/]]

** Mac OS X

RUnit requires X11 to run. Yosemite does not come with X11 installed.

See [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341][here]].

Apple originally created the XQuartz project to develop and support X11 on
OS X.

To Run RUnit you will need to install XQuartx.

You can get the dmg file [[http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/][here]].

Once XQuartz is installed you should be able to use RUnit.

* TestThat

TestThat is another framework that makes it easier to test in line if
you need to.

There is a [[https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf][pdf]] by the author describing how to use it.
