* DateTimes

Lubridate also handles date-times.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
this_moment <- now()
[1] "2015-08-26 13:43:37 BST"

# it has all the functions of time above
# addtionally it has

hour(this_moment)
[1] 13

minute(this_moment)
[1] 43

#+END_SRC

Lubridate offers a variety of functions for
parsing date-times.

These functions take the form of ymd(),
dmy(), hms(), ymd_hms(), etc., where each letter in the name
of the function stands for the location of years (y), months
(m), days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), and/or seconds (s) in
the date-time being read in.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
my_date <- ymd("1989-05-17")
[1] "1989-05-17 UTC

class(my_date)
[1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 

#lubridate can figure out many different date-time formats

ymd("1989 May 17")
[1] "1989-05-17 UTC"

mdy("March 12, 1975")
[1] "1975-03-12 UTC"

dmy(25081985)
[1] "1985-08-25 UTC"

# it generates an error message when it fails to parse properly
ymd("192012")
[1] NA
Warning message:
All formats failed to parse. No formats found. 

# dashes will help lubridate in such an instance
ymd("1920-1-2")
[1] "1920-01-02 UTC"

# lubridate can also parse date-times
ymd_hms("2014-08-23 17:23:02")
[1] "2014-08-23 17:23:02 UTC"

# or parse just a time
hms("03:22:14")
[1] "3H 22M 14S"

# lubridate handles vectors of dates in much the same way
dt2
[1] "2014-05-14" "2014-09-22" "2014-07-1"1

ymd(dt2)
[1] "2014-05-14 UTC" "2014-09-22 UTC" "2014-07-11 UTC"
